This is my very first post about how to build github pages with Hexo.
Below are some issue that I encounterd and settled when I was setting up. And I will sort them out by number.

## 1. First push

After 'git clone' the repository from origin to local, I followed the steps that Hexo tells to complete some basic settings, and then ran "hexo s", things was fine. However when trying to push them to origin master, git told me: 

"fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/DanaKuang/baymax.github.io.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403". 

Here is the solution:

``` bash
$ cd blog
$ vim .git/config
```

```
[remote "baymax-blog"]
        url = https://github.com/XXaccountXX/XXrepositoryXX.github.io.git

#change the above 'url' to the below

[remote "baymax-blog"]
        url = https://XXaccountXX@github.com/XXaccountXX/baymax.github.io.git       
```

Then "git push" again. After entering the password of repository, doneÔºÅ

"hexo deploy" can also help to push to origin.

``` bash
$ npm install hexo-deployer-git --save
```
