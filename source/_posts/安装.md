This is my very first post about how to build github pages with Hexo.
Below are some issue that I encounterd and settled when I was setting up. And I will sort them out by number.

## 1. First push

After 'git clone' the repository from origin to local, I followed the steps that Hexo tells and completed basic settings. However when trying to push them to origin master, git tells me "403" in return. Here is the solution:

``` bash
$ cd blog/.git
$ vim config
```

```
[remote "baymax-blog"]
        url = https://github.com/DanaKuang/baymax.github.io.git
```
